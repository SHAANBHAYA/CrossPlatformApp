Hi Everyone,
Welcome to the OMC first video for creating a cross platform
desktop application using python.Now to be clear we will not
be using any app development framework.For example you have Haxe,
Electron NodeW.js etc.We wont be using them because we want to 
make this simple. Also I wanted to show everyone how easy
it is to start desktop app development without having to learn
a framework.It will also give you a chance to understand how 
things work behind the scenes so when you do learn any 
framework you will be able to figure out stuff on your own or 
at least have a better understanding of it.

We will be making a very simple desktop app that can login to
an external web service.Thats it . We will create an installer
for both OSX and Windows so you can have a clear understanding
of how end to end development work.Cos "Its not done untill its 
shipped".

So we will start with setting up our development env.We will 
first install python from their website and install and IDE.

So for python you will need to go to google and type python3
for windows.We will click this link and click on the download button
.Once downloaded you will need to install it .

I hope you enjoy
this journey with me and i will see you in the next video.
