# PytonDesktopApp
***A simple way to create cross platform desktop python app.***

  Are you like me who is exhausted by all these different framework having a steep learning curve with languages "cough cough js" making no sense whatsoever.
  In this tutorial we will see how we can use Python3 to create a desktop app for Windows and OSX.We will cover everything from installation of python3 ,setting up
  dev env and then creating installers for mac and windows.
  
 
 # 1. Introduction and Motivation.
  
So before we start I wanted to lay a foundation on why I am doing this. For long I have been seeing this trend of using very bloated and messy frameworks that use all sorts of specialized tools and languages for the development of apps. I DONT LIKE THAT AT ALL. Beginners in tech needs to be taught simple tools first so they have better understanding of how things work.Introducing all the abstracted mess where users do not know what is happening and for every little thing have to do google search,because nothing makes any sense.

Things should be simple if we use "FRAMEWORK" and not make me learn some other developers bias for how to do stuff (Looking at you DJANGO). Don't get me wrong, I like frameworks when they are useful in automating some complex issues and problems (example ORM modules).But today we live in a framework **hell** where every little thing requires a whole mountain of stuff we need to learn, with languages we hate, to get something as simple as a login form. To end this tyranny, I a humble developer who will start with very simple python scripts and make our way up so that you have total control on how to do things.
Just look at all [these](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/frameworks-tools-build-cross-platform-desktop-apps/) libraries that are available for development of desktop apps. 
This  series is supposed to give you a simple Hello World experience on how to develop a cross platform app for desktop using just python as base language and then OS specific official tools so that you have a better understanding of the whole process and can learn these special "Frameworks" only if you need those additional functionality .
This will also help you to understand that sometimes simplicity will save you a lot of money and time when doing development,and maybe will help you make better choices in selecting the tools you may need in future.
